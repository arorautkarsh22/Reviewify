STUDENT REVIEW ANALYZER - README

========================================
üìå PROJECT SUMMARY
========================================
Student Review Analyzer is a data-driven project that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze feedback collected from students at institutions like Amity University and Kurukshetra University (KUK). The system processes responses gathered via Google Forms to extract and visualize common themes, sentiments, and frequently used words.

It aims to provide meaningful insights to administration and faculty to improve academic and campus experiences.
